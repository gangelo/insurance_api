# Questions

Please provide a short (less than 1 page) write up with your answers to the following questions.

## What are the 3 most important attributes of a high-performance software engineering team?

- Interpersonal skills/willingness to collaborate; most of us software engineering "types" can use a lot of help in this area :)
- Passion/personal desire to strive for excellence.
- Team members all on the same page; implies everyone understands and is working towards the common team goal(s)/mission.

## What do you love to do at work?

I LOVE to code, work as a team, strive for excellence, learn new things, find elegant solutions to difficult challenges,
and help others who are struggling.

## What do you not like to do at work?

I do not like to be idle. If things get slow, I'm feverishly working to learn something relevant or new. I also do not
like to be in "non-code-mode" for long periods of time, this tempts me to get bored.

## Talk about a time that you required input from a co-worker who was not being responsive, but you needed to get their input for you to continue. How did you handle this situation?

I try to handle these situations with persistence and understanding. People are busy, shy, have personal struggles and
a myriad of other "unknowns" we'll never be privy to.

Most recently, I desperately needed a code review from "Sam". Our sprint was coming to a close and I was working on
a high-visigility feature for one of our biggest clients, ConAM. I reached out to Sam, explained the situation and
the dire need to get this to QA as soon as possible. No response. I followed up the next day; again, no response. I
know Sam is in, because he's at our SoS ("Scrum of Scrums", daily company-wide scrum meeting). Product, in the meantime,
is getting nervous. There are now 4 days to the close of the sprint, and I know it will take about 1 day to QA,
with a 2-day buffer to fix and re-QA if any bugs get smoked out. Sam is definitely not a bad guy, but he is shy and
gets easily flustered; I don't get angry at him, he is who he is, but I need to get this out the door. Consequently,
despite the fact that Sam doesn't like phone calls, I make up my mind to reach out one last time via Team chat to
gently remind him of the urgency of the situation, and plan a follow-up phone call the next day if Sam doesn't respond.
Thankfully, Sam eventually did respond early the next day and provided a code review that afternoon. The feature
made it out the door in time. Anyhow, this is just one of several similar situations involving "Sam" that could have
become uncomfortable; however, I've gotten to know Sam a little bit. I actually like Sam, he's very straightforward
and honest which I like; but, he tends to isolate himself and get thrown for a loop when he gets (relatively) busy.
I simply try to work around who he is, and it works; any added pressure from me (in the wrong way) will work against us,
not just me. We're supposed to be on the same team, so I try to think in these terms.
